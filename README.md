A professional portfolio piece wherein I am using HTML and advanced CSS to style.

This portfolio displays all my completed works.

The nav bar is click responsive and will take you to the corresponding part on the webpage.

Upon hovering the images in the work, you'll be able to see a short demo(a gif) of the websites/apps I've worked on.
